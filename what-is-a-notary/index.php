                <p>A Notary Public is an official of integrity appointed by state government —typically by the
                    secretary of state — to serve the public as an impartial witness in performing a variety of official
                    fraud-deterrent acts related to the signing of important documents. These official acts are called
                    notarizations, or notarial acts. Notaries are publicly commissioned as “ministerial” officials,
                    meaning that they are expected to follow written rules without the exercise of significant personal
                    discretion, as would otherwise be the case with a “judicial” official.
                </p>

            <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 35px; margin-right: 35px;">
                <p>A Notary's duty is to screen the signers of important documents for their true identity, their
                    willingness to sign without duress or intimidation, and their awareness of the contents of the
                    document or transaction. Some notarizations also require the Notary to put the signer under an oath,
                    declaring under penalty of perjury that the information contained in a document is true and correct.
                    Property deeds, wills and powers of attorney are examples of documents that commonly require a Notary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Impartiality is the foundation of the Notary's public trust. They are duty-bound not to act in
                    situations where they have a personal interest. The public trusts that the Notary’s screening
                    tasks have not been corrupted by self-interest. And impartiality dictates that a Notary never
                    refuse to serve a person due to race, nationality, religion, politics, sexual orientation or status
                    as a non-customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As official representatives of the state, Notaries Public certify the proper execution of many of
                    the life-changing documents of private citizens — whether those diverse transactions convey real
                    estate, grant powers of attorney, establish a prenuptial agreement, or perform the multitude of
                    other activities that enable our civil society to function.

                <p>Through the process of notarization, Notaries deter fraud and establish that the signer knows what
                    document they’re signing, and that they’re a willing participant in the transaction.

                <p>Unlike Notaries in foreign countries, a U.S. Notary Public is not an attorney, judge or high-ranking
                    official. A U.S. Notary is not the same as a Notario Publico and these differences can be confusing
                    for immigrants when they approach Notaries in this country. Notaries in the United States should be
                    very clear about what they can or cannot do to serve immigrants the right way and steer clear of
                    notario issues.
